This program is an interactive program in which the user can learn some facts and statistics about 4 NFL teams: the Philadelphia Eagles, the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants, and the Washington Commanders. For a team that the user selects, the user can learn about the current starting lineup, the team's franchise record and its stats, the team's 2022-2023 season record and its stats, and website links that have been used for this project. Web-scarping is applied in this project for obtaining html code from multiple websites, and CSV files are generated for storing the data. I applied the Beautiful Soup package for the web scraping part of the program. 

Test Example: 
When the program starts executing, it will display a "Gathering Data" message to show that the program is gathering data. The program will display the main menu to show it is finishing gathering data. The user selects an NFL team.




After the user selects a team, a list of options will be displayed.


After selection, the desired output is displayed. The list of options will be displayed again. The user also can go back to the main menu to select another team or quit the program.
